# Gilded Rose

This is my take on the [Gilded Rose kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) in TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Getting started

Clone this repo and cd into it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicoToff/gilded-rose.git
cd gilded-rose
```

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Running app

To compile and run the app

```sh
npm run start:prod
```

Or with number of days as args:

```sh
npm run start:prod
```

<details>

<summary>Output folder</summary>

The compiled JS files will be in the `dist` folder.

</details>

## Running tests

All tests are written with Jest. To run then, simply run:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Development

Feel free to edit the files in this repository. When developping, use this script to run the app instead of `start:prod`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Want to know more?

Browse the code, and check out the README about the `AbstractItem` class in [src/utils/classes/items/](https://github.com/NicoToff/gilded-rose/tree/main/src/utils/classes/items).

Also feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions or suggestions!
